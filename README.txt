This project includes files for the control of the Adafruit 16x32 RGB LED Matrix display with a Pic18f45k20 programmed in PIC-C.

The Pic is programmed in such a way that inputting an image to display can be done by inputting a square array of 0-7 character length integers. Formatted like so:

{0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0},
{0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0},

};

Where 0 can be any integer value from 0 to 7.

Colour values are incremented in binary, in the form Red, Green, blue, with the least significant bit on the left.

So, red=on, green=off, blue=off would be 001 (reversed because least significant bit is on the left), would be one, would be red.
While red=on, green=on, blue=on would be 111, would be 7, would be white.

The matrix, itself, is pretty simple to write to. You write to two RGB LEDs at once, one on row i, and one on row i+8, where i is determined by pins A, B, and C, in a binary counter, not dissimilar to the way colour works.

A=off, B=off, C=off would be 000 in binary, which means you're addressing rows 0, and 8 (one and nine, if you don't start counting at zero).

Then, when you've got the data you want on one LED, you clock it, storing the state of the R, G, and B pins for that LED. Then, do the next one, and clock it, etc, 32 times, then latch to write the rows out. It's a simple, latched shift register.

Adjust the address, by incrementing your ABC pins, to write to the next row (be sure to clear the rows first, as the row above will ghost down if you don't. Amount of time before you clear it can be manipulated for PWM or Brightness control).

Repeat. Simple.
